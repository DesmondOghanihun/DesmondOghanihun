## Hi there 👋 I'm Desmond Ugegeh

**A highly analytical Ph.D. Researcher transitioning into Applied Data Science & Machine Learning Engineering.**

I specialize in leveraging advanced computational techniques, particularly **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, to solve complex real-world problems in environmental, conservation, and resource management domains. My expertise is grounded in strong statistical modeling, end-to-end data analysis, and scalable predictive modeling using Python.
